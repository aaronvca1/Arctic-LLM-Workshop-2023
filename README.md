# Arctic-LLM-Workshop-2023
Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the Arctic Large Language Models (LLMs) Workshop hosted by the Bio-AI Lab on the 27th and 28th of October, 2023. This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and resource center for all attendees and those interested in the world of LLMs.

## About the Workshop
This two-day workshop provided a blend of hands-on sessions and enlightening lectures aimed at unraveling the complexities of LLMs. Our approach was immersive and practical, ensuring participants not only gained knowledge but also experienced the thrill of innovation.

### What We Covered

- **Data Mastery**: 
  - Detailed exploration of data preparation for LLMs.
  - Hands-on language translation challenges for low-resource languages, including Norsk (Bokm√•l, Ny Norsk).

- **Ultra-Low Resource Languages**: 
  - Insightful discussions on handling languages like Sami with its 8 varieties.

- **Building Foundations**: 
  - Foundational model training from the ground up, covering requirements and intricacies.

- **Diverse Tasks**: 
  - Diverse data preparation strategies for LLM training across multiple tasks.

- **Fine-Tuning Simplified**: 
  - A straightforward approach to LLM fine-tuning.

- **Cutting-Edge Adaptation**: 
  - Introduction to LoRA-based adaptation for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

- **Innovation in Action**: 
  - Real-world LLM application development using OpenAI API, Langchain, and Huggingface resources.

- **Privacy Matters**: 
  - Presentation of PrivateGPT++ for private LLM-based application development, supported by our very own university's IT division.

- **Supercharged Training**: 
  - Strategies for accelerating foundational model training using distributed servers with Nvidia and AMD GPUs.
